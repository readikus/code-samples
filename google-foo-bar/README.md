# Google Foobar Challenges

I got an invite to the [Google Foobar](https://medium.com/plutonic-services/things-you-should-know-about-google-foobar-invitation-703a535bf30f) just as the COVID pandemic was starting. I did the first half of it, then the lockdown started and I was a bit overwhelmed/not in the right headspace to do brain breaking code challenges.

This is a collection of my entries for a number of the challanges. I have included the original questions as well as the Python code I submitted. At the time, I was just getting into my stride with python, so some of my choices were a little naive looking back. 

I'm comfortable admitting these are some of the hardest programming challenges I have ever done - they were pretty special to complete and I learnt a lot along the way.
