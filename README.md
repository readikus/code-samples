# Code Samples

This is a collection of various submissions for coding challenges, exercises, competitions etc. that hopefully gives an overview of my current level and approach to problems.

## Leetcode

A friend put me on to Leetcode a few years ago, and it was a great way to test what I had remembered my university days. I picked some of the challenges with the lowest success rates, to see how I got on at completing them. These were great fun to do, and I found it unpredictable whether I would quickly hit a nice solution, or if I would need to spend some time refining. One disappointing observation was the runtimes were highly variable, so when I ran the same code multiple times it could be in the top 5% or the bottom 5% depending on the circumstances of that particular run.

## Google Foo Bar

I was idlying Googling something to help me with a python package I was building, and suddenly the Google search results page changed in a rather suprising way. Before I knew it, I was at a web terminal doing some simple coding challenges. I didn't make a note of my solution to the first round, but it was "FizzBuzz" level, and I was able to do it in the web terminal within a few minutes. By the time the 2nd round kicked in, the solutions were less trivial. At the end of the third round, my brain was seriously hurting. This coincided with the start of the first COVID lockdown and the arrival of my (then) puppy, so whilst I throughly enjoyed these challenges, my mind wasn't fully focused, so I had a pause.
